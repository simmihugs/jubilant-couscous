#+TITLE: Learning about APIs

There are several APIs specifically designed for learning purposes
that you can use for free to practice API programming. Here are a few
options:

** NASA API
   NASA provides a public API that gives access to a
   wealth of data, including images, videos, and information about
   space missions. It's a great resource for learning how to interact
   with APIs and work with large datasets.
** Star Wars API
   This API allows you to access information about characters,
   planets, and vehicles from the Star Wars universe. It's a fun and
   engaging way to learn API programming.
** Pokémon API
   The Pokémon API provides data about Pokémon, their types, moves,
   and more. It's another enjoyable API to work with, especially if
   you're a fan of Pokémon.
** PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
   PRAW is a Python library that allows you to interact with Reddit's
   API. It's a great way to learn how to work with social media APIs
   and handle user-generated content.
** ClassMarker API
   This API helps educators create customizable tests and
   quizzes. It's useful for learning how to build and manage online
   assessments.
